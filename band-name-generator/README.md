# Band Name Generator

## Description

This project is a simple web-based application that generates a band name using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application combines a city name and a pet name input by the user to create a unique band name.

## How It Works

The application consists of the following components:

1. **HTML**: Provides the structure of the webpage, including input fields for the city and pet names and a button to generate the band name.
2. **CSS**: Styles the webpage to enhance the user interface and overall experience.
3. **JavaScript**: Contains the logic to generate the band name based on user inputs.

### JavaScript Functionality

The core functionality is implemented in the `generate` function:

- The function retrieves the values of the city and pet input fields.
- It then concatenates these values with a space in between to form the band name.
- The resulting band name is displayed in a designated output area on the webpage.


## Example

**Input:**
- City: "Los Angeles"
- Pet: "Tiger"

**Output:**
```
Your Band Name Could Be: Los Angeles Tiger
```

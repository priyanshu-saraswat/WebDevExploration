# BMI Calculator

## Description

This project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to input their weight and height to calculate their BMI and provides a category classification based on the calculated value.

## How It Works

The application consists of:

1. **HTML**: Provides the structure for input fields where users can enter their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters), along with a button to perform the calculation.
2. **CSS**: Styles the webpage for a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
3. **JavaScript**: Handles the BMI calculation and displays the result along with the BMI category.

### JavaScript Functionality

The core functionality is implemented in the `calculate` function:

- **Input Fields**: 
  - Users enter their **weight** in kilograms.
  - Users enter their **height** in meters.

- **Category Classification**: 
  - Based on the calculated BMI, the program classifies the result into categories such as Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, and Obesity.

- The result is displayed on the webpage along with the corresponding category.


## Example

**Input:**
- Weight: 70 kg
- Height: 1.75 m

**Output:**
```
Your BMI is 22.86 and you are classified as Normal weight.
```

This BMI Calculator is a handy tool for users to quickly determine their BMI and understand their weight status based on standardized categories.

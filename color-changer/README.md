# Color Changer

## Description

This project is a simple web-based **Color Changer** application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can click on buttons to dynamically change the background color of the page. The application also provides feedback by displaying a message when hovering over a button and applies stylish effects such as shadows and color transitions.

## How It Works

The application includes:

1. **HTML**: Defines the structure, including multiple color buttons and a paragraph that displays feedback when users hover over buttons.
2. **CSS**: Adds styling to buttons, the container, and other elements to enhance user interaction.
3. **JavaScript**: Manages the interaction logic, including background color changes, button hover effects, and dynamic text updates.

### JavaScript Functionality

- **Button Clicks**: When a user clicks a button, the background color of the webpage changes to match the button's label.
  
- **Hover Effects**: 
  - When a user hovers over a button, a message is displayed in a paragraph, informing them of the color they are about to select.
  - The button's background color changes to match the button text, and a shadow effect is applied to the container.
  
- **Mouse Out**: When the user moves the mouse away from a button, the button resets to a default black color, and the container shadow returns to white.

This **Color Changer** project offers a fun and interactive way for users to explore color changes with immediate visual feedback.
